I chose to use simpson's rule for integration for this assignment. I pulled my code from the original assignment that covered simpsons rule and adjusted it to read three new equations that I made up. I folllowed the outline in the hw6 handout for the folders and made them in VS code under the hmwk6 directory. VS code wouldn't run it, giving an error saying "no module named numpy" so I am just going to push to github and see if it will work over there...
